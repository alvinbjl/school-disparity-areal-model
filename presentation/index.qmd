## Introduction
Education is a foundational pillar of national development and its people. Key factors for quality education:

. . .

::: incremental
- Availability of school infrastructure
- Equitable access to schools
- Adequate teacher-to-student ratios 
- Safe and inclusive learning environments
:::

. . .

Several studies examined general aspects of education in Brunei.

First analysis through spatial methods & statistical models!

## Study Focus

::: callout-note
## Main goal

Identify adminstrative regions in Brunei where school availability falls significantly below the national baseline.
:::

. . .

This supports future policy planning and school placements. 

**Study Region:** Brunei Darussalam

**School Specification:** Primary & Secondary Government (PUBLIC) schools

**Region:** 39 Mukim (sub-division of district)



## Data

## Study Focus & Data Overview

- Key data:
  - School counts (2018; latest detailed data)
  - population (2021; census evey 10 years)
  - administrative boundaries  
  - Median house prices (1993â€“2025), used as socioeconomic covariate  
- Data from Bruneiverse GitHub mainly via `bruneimap` R package
- Missing house prices imputed via INLA-based Gaussian model; preferred over manual imputation  
- House prices are partially simulated estimates, may not fully reflect market values
- Raw school data in points; grouped into areal (mukim)
